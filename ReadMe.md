This is my project for my human interfaces class. I hosted my db and site on azure since I couldn't figure out how to use sailpoint.
Here is the source code, unfortunately you won't be able to run it since my database and site have long since been decommissioned (don't want to pay the fees for something i'm not using)
I was very proud of this application as I put a whole weekend of work into it.
I ended up getting a 90% on the project because when people were doing usability tests I didn't clean the database and everything was duplicated in the test so the database was a mess after 10 people put in the same info.
I also forgot to treat the ' value literally so it would also error out when someone tried this, I managed to realize but it was too late to change anything, but I went way out of scope of the project just to prove to
myself that I could still create a .net core application after being out of my co-op for 6 months.
